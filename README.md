## 1. Introduction

This project implements the **Connect 4 game in C** with an unbeatable AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.  
The goal is to design an algorithm where the computer player will **never lose to a human opponent**, ensuring optimal play at all times.  

It demonstrates **game theory in practice**, focusing on adversarial search and decision-making for turn-based board games.

## 2. What's Special?

The **Connect 4 ‚Äì Minimax AI** is not just a simple board game, but a complete educational platform for exploring:

- **Adversarial search** using Minimax  
- **Game tree exploration** with depth control  
- **Heuristic evaluation functions** for board scoring  
- **Optimal decision-making** in two-player zero-sum games  
- **C-based implementation** for efficiency and low-level control  

### Core Features
1. **AI Engine (Minimax)**  
   - Implements the Minimax algorithm with depth-based exploration  
   - Uses heuristic evaluation to score non-terminal states  
   - Ensures AI never loses against human input  

2. **Game Logic**  
   - Standard 7x6 Connect 4 board  
   - Checks for winning conditions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally  
   - Supports both AI vs Human and Human vs Human play  

3. **Heuristic Evaluation**  
   - Scores board states based on potential 2-in-a-row, 3-in-a-row, and winning 4-in-a-row  
   - Blocks opponent winning opportunities while maximizing AI‚Äôs chances

## 3. Bill of Materials (BOM)

### Core Requirements

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **C Compiler (GCC/Clang)** | Compiling source code |
| **Terminal/Console** | Running the game |
| **Makefile (optional)** | Build automation |

**Total Estimated Cost: $0 (software-only project)**  

### Tools Required
- Any C compiler (GCC recommended)  
- Text editor (VS Code, Vim, etc.)  
- Git for version control
